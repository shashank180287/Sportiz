AWS Course:
Take snip Lecture 29 @3:30, 5:06 and 5:33 / Lecture 35 @ 3:26 / Lecture 45 @ 3:02
write EFS Points

•	Restrict Viewer Access (Use Signed URLs or Signed Cookies) allowed your content to be viewed by specific group of users.
•	To login into Linux EC2 instance, use ec2-user@<IP address> as address while public DNS for EC2 instance look like ec2-<IP separated by - in place of .>.<region>.compute.amazonaws.com. While with Window EC2 instance, username is administrator
•	EBS are virtual Hard disks. Volumes exists on EBS. EBS volumes are placed in specific availability zones where they are automatically replicate to protect you from failure. One EBS volume cannot be mounted with multiple EC2 or EC2 instance from other Availability Zone. In these case, EFS is better. In EFS, permission can be declared at file and folder level. 
•	If you need more than 10K IOPS(I/O operations per second), Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1) is better than General Purpose SSD (GP2) which support 3 IOPS per GB with upto 10000 IOPS. HDD EBS disk can be used for processing sequential data.
<Place snip here>
•	Termination Protection is turned off by default for EC2 instance. 
•	By default, root EBS volume is deleted when the instance is terminated. With EBS backed EC2 instance, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume but the same is not possible for Instance Type volume backed EC2 instances. EBS root volume of default AMI cannot be encrypted. It can be done when creating AMI’s.
•	We cannot delete a snapshot of an EBS Volume that is used as the root device of a registered AMI. You must deregister the AMI before being able to delete the root device.
•	When you provision any new Security Group, all inbound traffic is blocked while all outbound traffic is allowed by default. You can specify allow rules only in Security Group. Security groups are Stateful so if you allow http inbound traffic, by default outbound traffic on http will also open, while Network Access List are stateless.
•	Snapshots are copy of hard-disk at given point of time. They are stored in S3. Every time you take a snapshot of a Volume, only incremental changes will be stored in S3. While recreating Volume from snapshot, you can change the type of Volume.
•	The best practice to take snapshot is to stop the EC2 instance and then take snapshot.
•	Command to create the snapshots using the command line tools : ec2-create-snapshot
•	Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically. Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are also encrypted automatically. Only encrypted snapshots can be shared.
•	RAID are collection of disk which can be worked as single Volume. This can be used when highest disk space available is not enough for your case. The main purpose of RAID is to improve IO. RAID 5 is collection if 3 or more volumes. For example, if you want to use some database like Casandra which is not supported by AWS.
<Place snip here>
•	EC2 with volume type Instance Store (Ephemeral Storage), you can add more than 1 Instance Volume bit before it’s launched. One you launch that instance, you can add only EBS instances to it.  The root device for Instance Store Volume backed EC2 instance is created from a template stored in Amazon S3. As Instance store templates are stored in S3, it will take more time to start EC2 instances.
•	You cannot stop the EC2 instance with Instance Store volume type. You will lose the data. But we can reboot these instances. EC2 Instance stop is required if underlying hypervisors is failed and need instance restart to reassign.
•	Load Balancer are not getting Public IPs like EC2 Instances. So ELB can be accessed by DNS only. There are two type of load balancer: 
1)	Application Load Balancer are preferred over classic load balancer. It does routing on Application layer.
2)	Classic Load Balancer does routing on TCP Layer.
•	SSL Termination on Load Balancer is supported so that your application wouldn’t have to worry about decrypting it. It also allows to identify originating IP address of client. For ELB, Response time is time wait in receiving response, it can be 2-60 sec. Interval is time between 2 consecutive checks, it can be 5-300 sec. Unhealthy threshold, no. of consecutive failure before declaring EC2 instance unhealthy.
•	CloudWatch provides Dashboard, Alarms, Events and Log monitoring. By default, AWS support 4 kinds of metrics: 1) Disk, 2) CPU, 3) Network and 4) Status Check. Standard Monitoring is always in 5 minute while detailed monitoring is also in 1 minute. CloudWatch monitors the EC2 environment while CloudTrail audit them.
•	System Status Check verifies that your instance is reachable. If this check fails, there may be an issue with the infrastructure hosting your instance (such as AWS power, networking or software systems). This check does not validate that your operating system and applications are accepting traffic. Instance Status Check verifies that your instance's operating system is accepting traffic. If this check fails, you may need to reboot your instance or make modifications to your operating system configuration.
•	IAM role attached EC2 instance, remain attached with instance until it’s deleted. We can attach a new IAM role to EC2 instance after it is created, only through command line not using console. But we can replace attached IAM role.
•	Any rule change apply to Security Group applies immediately and if you allows any port in inbound, that port will be allowed for outbound by default.
•	To get EC2 instance metadata, curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data URL in instance.
•	Placement Groups is logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. It is used for low network latency of 10 Gbps like for Casandra database which need fast network operations.
<Place snip here>
•	AWS management reevaluate the strategic business plan for Risk at least biannually.
•	To attach EFS with EC2 Instances, we should select same security groups in both service.
•	
•	Route53
•	If you use CName in Route53 for routing, you will be charged for that. The other option is Alias where you are not charged.
•	For each registered domain, AWS creates Hosted Zones and 2 record sets :NS and SOA (start of authority) records
•	Route53 is a global service.
•	For weighted routing, you can define weight from 0 to 255 and create one “A” record for each weight. AWS will determine the percentage and route n/w accordingly.
•	Route 53 support MX Records. A mail exchanger record (MX record) is a type of resource record in the Domain Name System that specifies a mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a recipient's domain, and a preference value used to prioritize mail delivery if multiple mail servers are available.
•	In Route53, we can manage 50 domain names by default, however it is a soft limit and can be raised by contacting AWS support.
•	Simple Notification Service SNS can be used for notification of scaling of a new EC2 instance.
•	Amazon SES stand for Simple Email Service. when you create a topic on Amazon SNS, an Amazon resource name is created.
•	Domain in SWF is collection of related workflows
•	RDS
•	* To access RDS from web application, RDS security group should have inbound from web application security group.
•	* Restored version from Automatic Backup or manual snapshot, will be new RDS instances with a new end point.
•	* To scale up the RDS database, take snapshot and while restore specify storage type.
•	* Multi AZ is only for disaster recovery only. Its not primarily used for improving performance. For performance improvement you need Read Replicas.
•	* Read replica support 5 replica for one database. Read replica is supported for Postgres, MySQL and MariaDB
•	* Elastic Cache supports Master/Slave replication and Multi AZ which can be used to achieve cross AZ redundancy.
•	* Elastic cache is a good choice if your database is read heavy and not prone to frequent changes while Redshift is useful if database is feeling stress because of heavy OLAP transaction on it.
•	* Aurora provides uoto 5 time better performance than MySQL at a price point one tenth of a commecial databases.
•	* If you loose primary db server, with Aurora Replicas(15), it will do the failover but with MySQL Read Replicas(5), it will not.
•	Flow logs enable you to capture IP traffic flow information for n/w interface in your resources.
•	* DB Instance with Priority tier 0 becomes master copy. Primary DB instance is always accessed by cluster DNS while other can be accessed by instance DNS address.
•	Once you create security group for any database, we should update inbound rule to allow access to other security group or ips.
•	While restoring database from snapshot, you need to create a new instance always.
•	
•	VPC
•	VPC Peering wouldn’t work if they have matching or overlapping CIDR(ip) block and if VPCs are in different regions. Peering does not support transitive peering relation b/w A and C if A->B and B->C.
•	AWS support active directory with SAML authentication where you will be authenticated with active directory first then given temporary credentials.
•	Through NAT instance, private subnet EC2 instance can access internet but people from internet cannot access(SSH) into these systems. For this purpose, Bastion is used.
•	VPC Flow logs help all VPC  n/w actions logging to cloud watch.
•	* When you create VPC, it creates N/w ACLs, securoty group and Route Tables by default.
•	* 1 subnet can be attached to one Availability Zone only. It can not be spanned to multiple AZ.
•	* By default AWS reserves 251 IPs for any new subnet. AWS reserves 5 IP addresses for their operation: 1) 10.0.0.0: N/W address, 2) 10.0.0.1 : Reserved for VPC router, 3) 10.0.0.2 : Reserved for DNS IP address, as its base of VPC network range plus 2, 4) 10.0.0.3 : Reserved for future use, 5) 10.0.0.255: N/W broadcast address, VPC does not support broadcast.
•	* You cannot attach multiple Internet gateway to VPC.
•	* AWS provided Elastic IPs which can be associated with any EC2 instances.
•	Deploy any EC2 instance in public subnet does not allow internet. You need to define elastic IP or elastic load balancer.
•	* NAT G/W and NAT Instance can be used to provide access to private subnet securely. NAT G/W is new and autoscalble as well no need to define secutiy group.
•	* For NAT instance, we should disable source destination check.
•	* N/W ACL created with VPC by default allows all inbound outbound traffic while if you create any custome N/w ACL, inbound-outbound traffic is denied.
•	* One Subnet can be attached to one AZ as well as one N/w ACL only. So if you add one subnet to any ACL, it will be removed from N/W ACL which was created with VPN.
•	* Even if you create inbound and outbound rule, you cannot access public subnet until you open the Ephemeral Ports on 1024-65535.
•	* N/W ACL rules are executed in order. They are not overrides. And to block any IP Addresses , we can use N/W ACL's not Security Group.
•	* To create high available system, we should have 2 publicly available subnet in 2 different AZ.
•	* One subnet is assigned to one availability zone only.
•	Kinesis
•	Kinesis stores data for 24 hours by default but it can be increased to 7 days. On the other hand, kinesis firehose sends data to underlying S3, Redshift (via S3) and Elastic search cluster immediately with Lambda analytic optionally.
•	Stream large amount of data in to the cloud, think Kinesis, processing large amount of data for business intelligence, think Redshift and process large data for Big Data Processing, think Elastic Map Reduce.
•	Elastic Transcoder convert media file per destination systems. Pay based on the minute that you transcode and the resolution at which you transcode.
