Roles are used to acquire specific permissions by AWS resources like EC2 or non AWS IAM users(using SAML) as policy can not be attached directly to them.
Your "default" VPC already has an IGW attached. Only 1 IGW can be attached to VPC at a time and IGW can not be detach from VPC is it has some active resources.
Placement Group throws "insufficient capacity error" if new instances are added later or PG is stopped and started again. To resolve this error, stop and start all member instances.
Placement Group cannot be merged but are connected with each other. PC name should be unique for your AWS account and instances must have 10gigabit network speed.
Volumes created from an EBS snapshot must be initialized. Initializing occurs the first time a "storage block on the volume is read" - and the performance impact can be impacted by up to 50%. You can avoid this impact in production environments by manually reading all the blocks.
IOPS are measured in size of 256KB "chunks".
S3 generates events for RRSObjectLost, ObjectCreated (Put, Post, Copy, CompleteMultipartUpload) and can be sent to SNS, SQS and Lambda
When you suspend object versioning, all existing objects retain their current and past versions, and no new versions are created when updated object are uploaded.
