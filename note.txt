AWS Course:
* By default, all the buckets and object in S3 are privately access until you provide access.
* In practical, S3 name does not have region name.
* S3 provide AES-256 server side encryption where data will be encrypted before storing in S3.
* In S3, there are two type of permission management, 1) Manage User for users present in IAM 2) Manage Public permission for AWS users or public.
* In S3, there are two type of access granted: 1) Objects which allows to create/modify/delete objects in bucket 2) Object Permission which allows to grant permissions of create/modify/delete to other users also.
* Once versioning is enabled in S3, it cannot be removed unless you delete the bucket though it can be disabled.
* Even you enable everyone read for bucket, for each object you need to enable it.
* While designing system for most cost effective ways with very large files, we might want versioning disable as if file is of 4GB and we change this slightly, total storage in S3 will be 8GB for single file.
* If you delete version, it cannot be restored but if you delete any object in S3, it can be restored by removing the marker of delete operation from old view if versioning is enabled.
